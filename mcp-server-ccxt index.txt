DESCRIPTION:
-----------
The MCP-Server-CCXT provides Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration
with the CCXT (CryptoCurrency eXchange Trading) library, enabling
the MayArbi arbitrage bot to interact with multiple cryptocurrency
exchanges through a unified interface.

Key features:
- Integration with 100+ cryptocurrency exchanges via CCXT
- Unified API for market data retrieval
- Order book and trading pair information
- Real-time price feeds and market depth data
- Support for both centralized and decentralized exchanges

This server enables the arbitrage bot to:
- Fetch real-time market data from multiple exchanges
- Compare prices across different trading venues
- Identify arbitrage opportunities
- Execute trades through supported exchanges
- Monitor market conditions and liquidity

The CCXT integration provides a robust foundation for multi-exchange
arbitrage operations, abstracting away the complexity of individual
exchange APIs while maintaining access to their full functionality.
