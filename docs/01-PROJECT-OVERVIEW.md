# ğŸ¯ MayArbi Project Overview

## What is MayArbi?

MayArbi is a **multi-chain DEX arbitrage bot** that starts small and thinks big. Our philosophy: **every green trade matters, even pennies!**

## ğŸŒŸ Core Concept

Instead of chasing big profits immediately, we:
1. **Start with micro-arbitrage** (even $0.01 profits)
2. **Learn from every trade** using our custom memory system
3. **Build patterns** from real market data
4. **Scale up** as confidence and capital grow

## ğŸ‰ï¸ Target Chains

- **ğŸ‘· Ethereum** - Primary hub with direct node access
- **ğŸ’º Arbitrum** - L2 speed and efficiency
- **ğŸ”µ Base** - Coinbase ecosystem opportunities  
- **ğŸ’– Vitruveo** - Early mover advantage with direct node

## ğŸ§  The Secret Sauce: DexMind

Our custom **MCP Memory Server** that remembers:
- Every profitable pattern
- Gas optimization strategies
- Market timing insights
- Failed attempts (to avoid repeating)

## ğŸš€ Why This Approach Works

1. **Low Risk Learning** - Start with pennies, not dollars
2. **Real Data** - Learn from actual market conditions
3. **Compound Knowledge** - Each trade makes the system smarter
4. **Scalable Foundation** - Built to grow from pennies to profits
