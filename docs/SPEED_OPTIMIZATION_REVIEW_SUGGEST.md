# 🧠 SPEED OPTIMIZATION REVIEW & SUGGESTIONS

Your **SPEED OPTIMIZATION PLAN** is 🔥 already — clear, structured, and well thought-out. That said, here are some **targeted comments, suggestions, and potential optimizations** to push it even further:

---

## 🔧 GENERAL COMMENTS

**✅ What’s Excellent:**

* Precise breakdown of current timings.
* Each optimization is paired with expected savings — very measurable.
* You have clear phases and risk assessment — that’s project-management gold.

---

## ⚡ SUGGESTIONS & OPTIMIZATIONS

### 🔀 1. **Persistent WebSocket RPCs Instead of HTTP**

* Use `WebsocketProvider` (e.g. `wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/ws`) to keep latency low and reduce TCP handshake overhead.
* Maintain **persistent long-lived Web3 instances** and just reset nonces or signer state if needed.

**⏱ Potential savings:** \~50–100ms per run.

---

### 🛠️ 2. **Pre-built, Signed Transactions**

* Build the transaction beforehand.
* Sign it offline with `.sign_transaction(...)`.
* Inject variables like `nonce` and `gasPrice` just-in-time.

**⏱ Potential savings:** \~150–250ms (especially skipping `eth_estimateGas`).

---

### 🧵 3. \*\*Use **`** or **`** instead of \*\*\`\`

* `asyncio` has more overhead than `trio` or `curio`, better for **high concurrency with low latency**.

**⏱ Potential savings:** \~50ms, scalable benefit.

---

### 🧠 4. **Gas Price Oracle Replacement**

* Replace external gas oracles with:

  * `pendingBlock.baseFeePerGas` + fixed tip
  * Mempool subscriptions (Flashbots, Blocknative)

**⏱ Potential savings:** \~100–200ms

---

### 📦 5. **Bundled Multicalls for Opportunity Validation**

* Consolidate balance checks, slippage, price impact into one `eth_call`

**⏱ Potential savings:** \~0.3–0.5s from validation layer

---

### 💻 6. **Rust-Python Hybrid (Optional Future)**

* Move core tx execution logic to **Rust via PyO3 bindings**

**⏱ Potential savings:** \~200–400ms in critical paths

---

## 🔦 CONTRACT OPTIMIZATION NOTES

Already mentioned:

* Remove unnecessary validations
* Use inline assembly for token transfer

**Further ideas:**

* Use `unchecked` math where safe
* Cache storage vars to memory
* Pack calldata args into struct

---

## ✅ FINAL TOUCHES

**Add telemetry logs** to each stage:

```python
start = time.perf_counter()
...
print("Step 3 time:", time.perf_counter() - start)
```

* Pinpoint drift in performance
* Catch RPC bottlenecks
* Optimize selectively

## 🧹 IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY (Extra Lean Version)

| Phase            | Effort | Risk | ROI       | Action      |
| ---------------- | ------ | ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| Persistent RPCs  | Low    | Low  | High      | ✅ Immediate |
| Parallel asyncio | Medium | Low  | High      | ✅ Immediate |
| Fixed gas logic  | Low    | Med  | Med       | ✅ Immediate |
| Contract speedup | High   | High | High      | ⏰ Plan+Test |
| Mempool boost    | Med    | Med  | Very High | ⏱ R\&D next |
