# üöÄ MayArbi Assistant Onboarding Guide

**Welcome to the MayArbi Arbitrage Project!** This guide will get you up to speed quickly on Lyle's sophisticated trading system.

## üë®‚Äçüíº About Lyle (Project Director)

### Background & Experience
- **Full-time commitment:** 7 months on this project, living off savings
- **Financial runway:** 2+ years remaining + expecting additional capital
- **Learning journey:** 3 years studying crypto/AI from zero knowledge
- **Coding background:** QuickBasic/Visual Basic era (dated but solid fundamentals)
- **Linux experience:** Fair experience, new to Arch but quick learner
- **Role:** Project director/problem-solver - provides plans, you handle implementation

### Working Style & Preferences
- **"Make a list, start at the top, work down until it's done"** - systematic approach
- **Fix errors immediately** with thorough solutions, not quick fixes
- **Repair over rebuild** when possible - cautious about risky changes
- **Break complex tasks** into manageable chunks
- **Address problems sequentially** from highest to lowest priority
- **No shortcuts** - focused on creating a functioning, profitable system

## üí∞ Current Financial Status

### Trading Capital
- **Initial funding:** $832 in arbitrage wallet
- **Current balance:** $765.56 total value
- **Holdings:** ETH, WETH, USDC, USDC.e, USDT across multiple chains
- **Target trade size:** Up to 75% of wallet value
- **Circuit breakers:** 5 consecutive losses OR 10% daily loss limit

### Profit Expectations
- **Daily targets:** $3000-8000 (Lyle expresses skepticism about these targets)
- **Minimum profit:** $10 per trade
- **Cost ratio limit:** 750% considered too high

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Infrastructure

### Hardware Setup
**Development Machine (Windows 11/WSL2):**
- CPU: 14700K, RAM: 64GB, GPU: RTX 4070Ti Super
- Storage: 4TB NVMe, Internet: 1.2Gb reliable
- Tools: VSCode with Augment, WSL2 with 32GB allocated

**Server Machine (Ubuntu):**
- CPU: 11900KF, RAM: 32GB, GPU: RTX 4070Ti 16GB  
- Storage: 2.4TB NVMe, Role: Ethereum node + future trading server
- Ethereum Node: Geth at 192.168.1.18:8546 (WebSocket enabled)

### Network & API Access
- **Ethereum Node:** Local Geth instance for mempool access
- **Alchemy:** Free tier (rate limited)
- **Base Node:** Planned deployment alongside Ethereum node
- **Target Migration:** Move bot from WSL2 to Ubuntu server, then to Arch Linux

## üîê Security & Configuration

### Environment Variables (CRITICAL)
**Lyle uses system environment variables, NOT .env files!**
- **Why:** .env files were accidentally pushed to GitHub TWICE, requiring key rotation
- **Storage:** All sensitive data in system environment variables
- **Persistence:** Variables stored in ~/.bashrc for permanence

### Key Environment Variables
```bash
# API Keys
ALCHEMY_API_KEY="your_key"
GECKO_KEY="CG-w6zYkP9CY5m3Nc1ZJdboDcpC"

# Wallet Configuration  
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY="your_key"
WALLET_ADDRESS="0x55e701F8...67B1"

# Trading Configuration
ENABLE_REAL_TRANSACTIONS="true"
MAX_TRADE_SIZE_USD="500"
MIN_PROFIT_USD="10"

# Network
ETHEREUM_NODE_URL="ws://192.168.1.18:8546"
```

**NEVER suggest .env files - Lyle destroys them daily for security!**

## üéØ Trading Strategy & Preferences

### Ethical MEV Focus
- **Preferred:** Liquidation bots, cross-chain MEV, flashloan arbitrage
- **Avoided:** Exploitative sandwich attacks
- **Target chains:** L2 networks (Arbitrum, Base, Optimism) over Ethereum mainnet
- **Flashloan preference:** DyDx and Balancer (cheaper than Aave)

### System Scope
- **Networks:** 8 blockchains (Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon, BSC, Scroll, Mantle, Blast)
- **DEXs monitored:** 43 DEXs across all networks
- **Gas strategy:** Higher than most traders for priority, but cost-conscious
- **Cross-chain:** YES, Flashloans: YES, Quick fixes: NO

### Secret Weapon: Bot Hunter System
**Lyle accidentally built a sophisticated MEV bot detection system:**
- **Purpose:** Originally for finding lesser-known DEXs
- **Discovery:** Script identifies competitor bot addresses
- **Strategy:** "Frontrunning the Frontrunners" - ethical bot-vs-bot competition
- **Files:** `src/ethereum_node/frontrun_frontrunners.py`, `src/intelligence/competitor_bot_monitor.py`
- **Advantage:** Pre-validated opportunities, competitive intelligence

## üö® Critical Issues & Status

### Current System Problems
1. **Mock Data Contamination:** 511 violations found across codebase
2. **Balance Checking Delays:** 7+ second delays despite caching
3. **Execution Abandonment:** System starts trades but abandons mid-process
4. **Threading Conflicts:** Multiple concurrent systems competing

### Recent Fixes
- **Phantom Profits Bug:** FIXED - system was reporting success on failed transactions
- **Transaction Validation:** Now properly checks receipt.status
- **Performance Optimizations:** 3.5x speed improvement (14s ‚Üí 4s execution)

### Development History
- **Transition:** Successfully moved from simulation to real blockchain execution
- **Deployments:** Flashloan contracts deployed on Optimism and Base
- **Monitoring:** Dashboard incomplete, abandoned during development
- **Mock Data:** Persistent contamination from previous assistants

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Preferences & Rules

### Code Quality Standards
- **No mock data:** Even single static values can cause major problems
- **Real data only:** Centralized config files over hardcoded values
- **Package managers:** Always use npm/pip/etc, never edit package files manually
- **Systematic approach:** Fix components one at a time
- **Clean up:** Delete test files when done, maintain directory index files

### File Organization
- **Directory indexes:** Each directory needs `<DIRECTORY_NAME>_INDEX.md` describing all files
- **Memory bank:** Essential project documentation in `memory-bank/` directory
- **No placeholders:** Avoid mock data at all costs

### Communication Style
- **Technical enthusiasm:** Lyle appreciates energy and technical depth
- **Practical focus:** Solutions over theory
- **Systematic planning:** Always make detailed plans before implementation
- **Progress tracking:** Clear status updates and next steps
