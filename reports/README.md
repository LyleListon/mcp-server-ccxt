## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Warnings**

### **DO NOT DEPLOY** until:
1. ‚úÖ Execution engine implemented and tested
2. ‚úÖ Real bridge API integration completed
3. ‚úÖ Price feed redundancy added
4. ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing on testnet
5. ‚úÖ Small-scale validation with $50-$100

### **Current Risks**
- **Simulated data creates false confidence**
- **No real transaction capability**
- **Single points of failure throughout system**
- **Missing critical safety mechanisms**

---

## üìû **Next Steps**

1. **Review Executive Summary** for overall understanding
2. **Read Critical Priority reports** (Execution, Bridge, Price Feeds)
3. **Plan implementation** starting with Execution Engine
4. **Set up testnet environment** for safe development
5. **Begin with wallet integration** as foundation

**Remember**: The system has excellent potential but requires significant work before live deployment. Focus on safety and thorough testing over speed.
