DESCRIPTION:
-----------
The MCP Memory Service provides persistent memory capabilities for the
MayArbi arbitrage bot through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Key features:
- Persistent memory storage using vector databases
- Semantic search and retrieval of stored information
- Integration with AI models for intelligent memory management
- Support for various data types and formats
- Efficient indexing and querying capabilities

This service enables the arbitrage bot to:
- Remember historical trading patterns and outcomes
- Store and retrieve market analysis data
- Maintain context across trading sessions
- Learn from past experiences and improve decision-making

The service uses modern vector database technology (Chroma) to provide
fast and accurate semantic search capabilities, allowing the bot to
quickly find relevant historical information when making trading decisions.
