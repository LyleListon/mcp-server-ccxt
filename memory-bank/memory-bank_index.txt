MEMORY BANK STRUCTURE:
=====================

Core Files Hierarchy:
projectbrief.md (Foundation)
â”œâ”€â”€ productContext.md (Why/How)
â”œâ”€â”€ systemPatterns.md (Architecture)
â””â”€â”€ techContext.md (Technology)
    â””â”€â”€ activeContext.md (Current State)
        â””â”€â”€ progress.md (Status/Evolution)

File Dependencies:
- projectbrief.md: Foundation document, no dependencies
- productContext.md: Builds on project brief
- systemPatterns.md: Builds on project brief
- techContext.md: Builds on project brief
- activeContext.md: Builds on product, system, and tech context
- progress.md: Builds on active context and all other files

USAGE GUIDELINES:
================

Reading Order (Start of Session):
1. projectbrief.md - Understand project scope and goals
2. productContext.md - Understand user needs and product vision
3. systemPatterns.md - Understand architecture and technical decisions
4. techContext.md - Understand technology stack and constraints
5. activeContext.md - Understand current work focus and recent changes
6. progress.md - Understand what's complete and what's next

Update Triggers:
- New project patterns discovered
- After implementing significant changes
- User requests "update memory bank"
- Context needs clarification
- Major milestones reached

Update Process:
1. Review ALL files (even if no changes needed)
2. Document current state accurately
3. Clarify next steps and priorities
4. Document insights and patterns learned
5. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md

CURRENT PROJECT STATE:
=====================

System Integration Plan Progress: 75% Complete (3/4 phases)
âœ… Phase 1: Component Health Monitoring - COMPLETE
âœ… Phase 2: Error Propagation & Recovery - COMPLETE  
âœ… Phase 3: Data Flow Coordination - COMPLETE
ðŸš§ Phase 4: Resource Management - READY TO IMPLEMENT

Next Session Priority: Complete Resource Management (System Integration Plan Phase 4)

Capital Status: $600 in Arbitrum wallet, ready for live trading
System Readiness: 75% complete, excellent foundation established
Technical Issues: Minor (MCP modules, API keys) - easily resolved

The Memory Bank provides complete project continuity across sessions and ensures
Augment Code can immediately understand project context and continue work effectively.
