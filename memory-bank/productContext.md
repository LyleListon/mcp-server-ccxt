# Product Context

## Why MayArbi Exists

### The Problem
The DeFi ecosystem presents continuous arbitrage opportunities across multiple decentralized exchanges, but manual trading is:
- **Too Slow**: Price differentials disappear within seconds
- **Too Complex**: Monitoring dozens of DEXs across multiple chains simultaneously
- **Too Risky**: Manual execution prone to errors and emotional decisions
- **Too Limited**: Human traders can't operate 24/7 or process multiple opportunities simultaneously

### The Opportunity
- **Price Inefficiencies**: DEXs often have price differences of 0.1-2% that can be captured
- **Cross-Chain Arbitrage**: Bridge costs create additional arbitrage opportunities
- **Market Growth**: DeFi volume continues expanding, creating more opportunities
- **Automation Advantage**: Bots can react faster and more consistently than humans

### Target User
**Primary User Profile:**
- Individual DeFi trader with limited capital ($600-$10,000)
- Technically sophisticated but time-constrained
- Seeks passive income through automated trading
- Risk-conscious but willing to deploy real capital for learning
- Values transparency and control over black-box solutions

**User Pain Points:**
- Existing arbitrage bots are expensive or require large minimum capital
- Manual arbitrage trading is exhausting and error-prone
- Lack of transparency in commercial arbitrage solutions
- Difficulty learning from trading patterns and market behavior
- High gas costs eating into small-scale arbitrage profits

### Success Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Stablecoin Arbitrage
- System detects USDC trading at $1.002 on Uniswap, $0.998 on SushiSwap
- Calculates profit after gas costs: $2.40 on $600 trade
- Executes buy on SushiSwap, sell on Uniswap
- Trade completes in 30 seconds with $2.40 profit
- System records pattern for future optimization

#### Scenario 2: Cross-Chain Opportunity
- ETH price difference between Ethereum ($2500) and Arbitrum ($2495)
- Bridge cost analysis shows $0.90 transfer cost
- Profit calculation: $5 - $0.90 = $4.10 on 1 ETH trade
- System executes cross-chain arbitrage
- Records bridge cost patterns for future trades

#### Scenario 3: Risk Management
- System detects large arbitrage opportunity (potential $50 profit)
- Risk analysis shows unusual market conditions and high slippage risk
- Circuit breaker activates, preventing potentially risky trade
- System logs decision rationale for learning
- User is notified of risk-based trade rejection

### User Experience Goals
- **Confidence**: User trusts system to make good decisions with their capital
- **Learning**: User gains insights into DeFi markets and arbitrage strategies
- **Growth**: Both capital and knowledge compound over time
- **Control**: User maintains oversight and can adjust parameters
- **Transparency**: Every decision and trade is explainable and auditable
