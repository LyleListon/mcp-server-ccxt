# MayArbi Project Brief

## Project Overview
MayArbi is a sophisticated multi-chain DEX arbitrage bot designed to identify and execute profitable arbitrage opportunities across decentralized exchanges. The project emphasizes starting small with real capital ($600) and scaling systematically through intelligent automation and comprehensive memory systems.

## Core Requirements
- **Real Capital Trading**: Deploy with actual funds ($600 initial capital) rather than simulations
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Arbitrage across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism networks
- **Cross-Chain MEV**: Leverage bridge cost differentials for enhanced profitability
- **Comprehensive Memory**: Learn from every trade, pattern, and market condition
- **Risk Management**: Circuit breakers, position sizing, and loss limits
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built to grow from hundreds to thousands in capital

## Primary Goals
1. **Profitable Arbitrage**: Generate consistent returns through DEX price differentials
2. **Knowledge Accumulation**: Build comprehensive trading intelligence through MCP memory systems
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Protect capital through sophisticated error handling and circuit breakers
4. **Systematic Scaling**: Grow capital and opportunities through proven patterns
5. **Market Intelligence**: Develop deep understanding of DeFi market dynamics

## Success Metrics
- **Profitability**: Positive returns after gas costs and fees
- **Consistency**: Regular profitable trades with controlled drawdowns
- **Learning Rate**: Continuous improvement in trade selection and execution
- **Capital Growth**: Systematic increase in deployable capital
- **System Reliability**: High uptime and error recovery rates

## Project Scope
**In Scope:**
- DEX arbitrage on major chains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism)
- Cross-chain arbitrage using bridge cost analysis
- Real-time price monitoring and opportunity detection
- Automated trade execution with risk controls
- Comprehensive memory and learning systems
- Performance analytics and optimization

**Out of Scope:**
- Sandwich attacks or exploitative MEV strategies
- Lending protocol interactions
- NFT or exotic asset arbitrage
- High-frequency trading requiring specialized infrastructure
- Regulatory compliance beyond basic operational requirements

## Key Constraints
- **Capital Limitation**: Starting with $600, requiring careful position sizing
- **Gas Cost Sensitivity**: Must account for transaction costs in profitability calculations
- **Network Dependencies**: Reliant on blockchain network stability and API availability
- **Regulatory Environment**: Must operate within legal frameworks
- **Technical Complexity**: Requires sophisticated error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Project Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Foundation and monitoring systems (Complete)
- **Phase 2**: Basic arbitrage detection and execution (In Progress)
- **Phase 3**: Cross-chain MEV implementation (Planned)
- **Phase 4**: Advanced optimization and scaling (Future)

## Stakeholders
- **Primary User**: Individual trader seeking automated arbitrage profits
- **Technical Team**: Development and maintenance of the arbitrage system
- **Market Participants**: DeFi ecosystem users and liquidity providers
