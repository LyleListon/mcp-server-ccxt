# MayArbi: MCP-Enhanced Arbitrage Bot

## Project Vision
Build an advanced, automated arbitrage trading system that leverages the power of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to create a sophisticated, learning-capable bot that can identify and execute profitable trades across multiple decentralized exchanges.

## Core Objectives
1. **Automated Arbitrage Detection**: Real-time identification of price discrepancies across DEXs
2. **MEV Protection**: Advanced protection against front-running and sandwich attacks using Flashbots
3. **Capital Efficiency**: Flash loan integration for capital-efficient arbitrage execution
4. **Learning Capability**: Use MCP Memory and Knowledge Graph servers to learn from patterns
5. **Multi-Chain Support**: Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, and Vitruveo networks
6. **Real-time Intelligence**: Multi-source market data aggregation via MCP servers

## Legacy Foundation
This project builds upon substantial existing work:
- **Arby 2-22-25**: Sophisticated arbitrage engine with NetworkX path finding
- **Listonian-bot**: Production-ready MEV protection and Flashbots integration
- **Enhanced Components**: Advanced flash loan management and cross-DEX detection
- **Configuration Systems**: Environment-specific configuration management

## MCP Enhancement Strategy
- **DexMind**: Custom memory server for arbitrage pattern storage and learning
- **Web3 MCP Servers**: Real-time blockchain and market data (Coincap, Coinmarket, CCXT)
- **Memory Servers**: Opportunity caching and pattern recognition
- **Knowledge Graph**: Token relationships and market condition modeling
- **FileScopeMCP**: Project organization and strategy tracking

## Success Metrics
- Profitable arbitrage execution with minimal capital requirements
- Sub-second opportunity detection and execution
- MEV protection effectiveness > 95%
- Learning system improving detection accuracy over time
- Multi-chain arbitrage capabilities operational

## Technical Architecture
- **Core Engine**: Migrated sophisticated arbitrage detection and execution
- **MCP Integration**: Enhanced with real-time data and learning capabilities
- **Security First**: MEV protection and secure transaction handling
- **Scalable Design**: Modular architecture supporting multiple strategies

## Target Outcomes
- Automated profitable arbitrage trading
- Advanced market intelligence and pattern recognition
- Robust MEV protection and secure execution
- Comprehensive monitoring and analytics
