# 🚀 MayArbi - Multi-Chain DEX Arbitrage Bot

> **Starting small, thinking big!** Every green trade matters, even pennies! 💰

## 🎯 Project Vision

MayArbi is an automated multi-chain DEX arbitrage bot designed to identify and execute profitable trades across decentralized exchanges. Built with a custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) memory system called **DexMind**, it learns from every trade to continuously improve performance.

### 🌟 Key Features

- **🧠 DexMind Memory System**: Custom MCP server that remembers every trade pattern
- **🌐 Multi-Chain Support**: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, and Vitruveo
- **⚡ Direct Node Access**: Ultra-low latency with personal Ethereum and Vitruveo nodes
- **💎 MEV Opportunities**: Mempool visibility for advanced trading strategies
- **📊 Comprehensive Analytics**: Track performance from pennies to profits
- **🔧 MCP Integration**: Seamless integration with AI coding assistants

2. **Configure MCP servers** in your Augment Code extension
3. **Initialize DexMind** memory database
4. **Start monitoring** for arbitrage opportunities

## 📊 Philosophy: Every Penny Counts

MayArbi starts with a simple philosophy: **any green trade is profit worth tracking**. We begin by:

1. **Learning patterns** from micro-arbitrage opportunities
2. **Building memory** of successful strategies
3. **Optimizing gas costs** vs profit margins
4. **Scaling up** as confidence and capital grow

## 🧠 DexMind Memory System

DexMind is our custom MCP memory server that tracks:

- **💰 Trade Results**: Every profit and loss, down to the penny
- **⚡ Gas Optimization**: Cost analysis across chains
- **📈 Market Patterns**: Timing and liquidity insights
- **🎯 Strategy Performance**: What works and what doesn't
- **🔮 MEV Opportunities**: Advanced trading patterns
