# 🚀 MayArbi - Multi-Chain DEX Arbitrage Bot

> **Starting small, thinking big!** Every green trade matters, even pennies! 💰

## 🎯 Project Vision

MayArbi is an automated multi-chain DEX arbitrage bot designed to identify and execute profitable trades across decentralized exchanges. Built with a custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) memory system called **DexMind**, it learns from every trade to continuously improve performance.

### 🌟 Key Features (Phase 2 Enhanced)

- **🧠 DexMind Memory System**: Custom MCP server that remembers every trade pattern
- **🛡️ MEV Protection**: Flashbots integration with intelligent bundle submission
- **🎯 AI-Powered Detection**: Enhanced cross-DEX opportunities with confidence scoring
- **📊 Performance Analytics**: Real-time tracking, learning, and strategy optimization
- **🌐 Multi-Chain Support**: 13 DEX ecosystem across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism
- **⚡ Flash Loan Integration**: Multi-protocol support with cost optimization
- **🔮 Predictive Modeling**: Success probability forecasting based on historical patterns
- **🔧 MCP Integration**: Seamless integration with AI coding assistants

3. **Initialize DexMind** memory database
4. **Start monitoring** for arbitrage opportunities

## 📊 Philosophy: Every Penny Counts

MayArbi starts with a simple philosophy: **any green trade is profit worth tracking**. We begin by:

1. **Learning patterns** from micro-arbitrage opportunities
2. **Building memory** of successful strategies
3. **Optimizing gas costs** vs profit margins
4. **Scaling up** as confidence and capital grow

## 🧠 DexMind Memory System
