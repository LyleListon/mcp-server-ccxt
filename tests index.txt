DESCRIPTION:
-----------
This directory contains the comprehensive test suite for the MayArbi
arbitrage bot project. The tests are organized into three categories:

1. Unit Tests (unit/):
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Fast execution for development feedback

2. Integration Tests (integration/):
   - Test component interactions
   - Test with real or realistic external services
   - Validate system integration points

3. End-to-End Tests (e2e/):
   - Test complete user workflows
   - Test the entire system from start to finish
   - Validate business requirements

The test suite ensures code quality, prevents regressions,
and validates that the arbitrage bot functions correctly
under various conditions and scenarios.
