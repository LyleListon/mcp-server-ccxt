LOAD BALANCING ALGORITHMS:
=========================

1. Round Robin
   - Simple equal distribution
   - Good for uniform workloads
   - No performance consideration

2. Weighted Round Robin
   - Distribution based on component weights
   - Considers component capacity differences
   - Maintains proportional distribution

3. Least Connections
   - Routes to component with fewest active tasks
   - Good for varying task durations
   - Prevents overloading busy components

4. Least Response Time
   - Routes to fastest responding component
   - Optimizes for latency
   - Performance-aware routing

5. Resource-Based
   - Matches request requirements to available resources
   - Considers CPU, Memory, Network, Storage needs
   - Prevents resource exhaustion

6. Performance-Based
   - Routes based on success rate and performance metrics
   - Considers throughput and response times
   - Optimizes for overall system performance

7. Adaptive (Default)
   - Combines multiple strategies based on context
   - CRITICAL requests → Performance-based
   - HIGH requests → Performance + Resource balance
   - NORMAL/LOW requests → Least connections
   - Dynamic strategy selection
