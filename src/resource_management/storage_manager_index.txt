   - 14 days data retention, 3 days logs, 6 hours cache
   - Time-based cleanup, 4-hour intervals
   - Compression enabled, backup disabled

STORAGE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
===========================

Base directories automatically created:
- data/     - Persistent application data
- logs/     - Log files
- cache/    - Temporary cache files
- config/   - Configuration files
- temp/     - Temporary files
- backup/   - Backup files

Each component gets subdirectories under each base directory:
- data/arbitrage_engine/
- logs/arbitrage_engine/
- cache/arbitrage_engine/
- etc.

KEY CLASSES:
===========

1. StorageManager
   - Main orchestrator class
   - Async start/stop methods
   - 4 monitoring loops (storage, cleanup, optimization, health)
   - Comprehensive metrics collection

2. StorageConfig
   - Configuration dataclass
   - Monitoring intervals and thresholds
   - Cleanup and optimization settings
   - Alert configuration

3. StorageAllocation
   - Per-component storage allocation
   - Storage limits and retention policies
   - Cleanup strategy and intervals
   - Priority and optimization settings

4. StorageMetrics
   - Real-time storage metrics
   - File counts and sizes
   - Cleanup statistics
   - Performance tracking

5. StorageAlert
   - Alert management system
   - Usage-based alerts
   - Component-specific notifications

CLEANUP STRATEGIES:
==================

1. Time-Based Cleanup
   - Deletes files based on age
   - Different retention for logs, cache, temp, data
   - Configurable retention periods per component

2. Size-Based Cleanup
   - Deletes largest files first
   - Targets specific usage thresholds
   - Stops when target reached

3. LRU (Least Recently Used)
   - Deletes files by access time
   - Preserves frequently accessed files
   - Good for cache management

4. Priority-Based Cleanup
   - Cleanup order: temp -> cache -> logs -> data -> backup -> config
   - Preserves critical data longest
   - Emergency cleanup strategy

5. Adaptive Cleanup
   - Combines multiple strategies
   - Starts with time-based, escalates as needed
   - Most comprehensive approach

MONITORING LOOPS:
================

1. Storage Monitor Loop (30s interval)
   - System and component usage tracking
   - Alert checking and generation
   - Metrics collection and history

2. Cleanup Manager Loop (1h interval)
   - Scheduled cleanup execution
   - Emergency cleanup detection
   - Cleanup need assessment

3. Optimization Loop (2h interval)
   - Storage pattern analysis
   - Allocation optimization
   - Defragmentation checks

4. Health Monitor Loop (30m interval)
   - File system health checks
   - Access pattern monitoring
   - Storage integrity verification

PUBLIC API METHODS:
==================

- start_storage_management() / stop_storage_management()
- get_storage_metrics() -> Dict[str, Any]
- cleanup_component_storage(component, force=False) -> Dict[str, Any]
- get_storage_dashboard_data() -> Dict[str, Any]

INTEGRATION POINTS:
==================

- Health Monitor: Storage health alerts and metrics
- Error Manager: Storage-related error recovery
- Data Flow Coordinator: Storage usage data flows
- Resource Manager: Main resource orchestrator integration

STATE PERSISTENCE:
=================

- Saves cleanup history and storage metrics
- Restores state on startup
- JSON-based state storage in data/storage_manager_state.json

ALERT THRESHOLDS:
================

- Storage: 80% warning, 95% critical (of allocated space)
- System: 85% warning, 95% critical (of total disk)
- Emergency cleanup: 90% system usage
- Alert cooldown: 10 minutes

PERFORMANCE FEATURES:
====================

- Automatic directory creation
- Efficient recursive file operations
- Comprehensive cleanup strategies
- Emergency cleanup for critical situations
- Storage pattern analysis
- Access pattern monitoring
- File system health checks

The Storage Manager is fully implemented and ready for integration with the Resource Management system. It provides comprehensive storage resource management with advanced features like multiple cleanup strategies, data retention policies, and emergency cleanup capabilities.
