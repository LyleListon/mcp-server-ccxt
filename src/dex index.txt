DESCRIPTION:

This directory contains adapters for various decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
that the MayArbi arbitrage bot can interact with. Each adapter implements
a standardized interface defined in base_dex.py to ensure consistent
behavior across different exchanges.

Supported DEXs:
- Aerodrome: Base network DEX
- Camelot: Arbitrum-based DEX with unique features
- KyberSwap: Dynamic market maker protocol
- 1inch: DEX aggregator for optimal routing
- ParaSwap: Multi-DEX aggregator
- SushiSwap: Community-driven DEX
- Trader Joe: Avalanche-based DEX
- Uniswap V3: Leading Ethereum DEX with concentrated liquidity

Key functionality:
- Price fetching and comparison
- Liquidity analysis
- Trade execution
- Gas estimation
- Slippage calculation
- Real-time market data

The dex_manager.py coordinates all adapters and provides a unified
interface for the arbitrage bot to interact with multiple DEXs
simultaneously.
