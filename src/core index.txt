execution/ - Trade execution and order management

DESCRIPTION:
-----------
This directory contains the core business logic for the MayArbi
arbitrage bot. It implements the fundamental algorithms and
processes that drive the bot's arbitrage operations.

Key components:

1. Arbitrage (arbitrage/):
   - Price difference calculation algorithms
   - Profit estimation and validation
   - Risk assessment and management
   - Multi-hop arbitrage path finding

2. Detection (detection/):
   - Real-time opportunity scanning
   - Market inefficiency identification
   - Signal processing and filtering
   - Threshold-based alerting

3. Execution (execution/):
   - Trade order management
   - Transaction sequencing and timing
   - Slippage protection
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Gas optimization strategies

The core module is designed to be:
- High-performance for real-time operations
- Modular for easy testing and maintenance
- Extensible for new arbitrage strategies
- Robust with comprehensive error handling

This is the heart of the arbitrage bot where all critical
trading decisions are made and executed.
