DESCRIPTION:
-----------
This directory contains shared utilities and common functionality
used across multiple components of the MayArbi arbitrage bot.

Key components:

1. Events (events/):
   - Event-driven architecture support
   - Message passing between components
   - Event subscription and publishing
   - Asynchronous event handling

Common functionality includes:
- Shared data structures and models
- Common constants and enumerations
- Utility functions used across modules
- Configuration management helpers
- Logging and error handling utilities
- Validation and sanitization functions

Design principles:
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - centralized common code
- Consistency - standardized interfaces and patterns
- Reusability - modular and composable components
- Maintainability - well-documented and tested code

The common directory serves as a foundation layer that:
- Reduces code duplication
- Ensures consistency across the application
- Provides shared abstractions and utilities
- Facilitates communication between components
- Simplifies maintenance and updates

This module is essential for maintaining a clean, organized,
and maintainable codebase as the arbitrage bot grows in
complexity and functionality.
