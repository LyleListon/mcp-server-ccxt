DESCRIPTION:
-----------
The orchestration directory contains Phase 3 components for advanced MCP server
orchestration and data fusion capabilities.

PHASE 3 CHUNKS IMPLEMENTED:
===========================

✅ CHUNK 1: MCP Server Registry (server_registry.py)
   - Centralized registry for all MCP servers
   - Server capability tracking and metadata management
   - Health status monitoring and discovery
   - Server lookup by type, capability, and tags
   - Automatic health monitoring with status updates
   - Registry export/import functionality

✅ CHUNK 2: Data Fusion Engine (data_fusion_engine.py)
   - Intelligent data combination from multiple MCP sources
   - Conflict resolution with multiple strategies (priority, majority vote, quality)
   - Data validation and quality assessment
   - Caching system for performance optimization
   - Concurrent data collection from multiple servers
   - Support for different fusion strategies and conflict resolution

✅ CHUNK 3: Real-time Data Pipeline (real_time_pipeline.py)
   - Real-time data flow management with event streaming
   - Pub/sub event system with subscription management
   - Concurrent data producers for real-time capable servers
   - Event batching and processing with backpressure handling
   - Stream-specific processors for different event types
   - Event history and replay capabilities
   - Performance metrics and monitoring

✅ CHUNK 4: MCP Coordinator Service (coordinator_service.py)
   - Orchestrates complex multi-server workflows (arbitrage analysis)
   - Intelligent load balancing with real-time server selection
   - Atomic transaction coordination with ACID properties
   - Failover handling and server health monitoring
   - Performance metrics and operation tracking
   - Concurrent operation management
   - Multi-phase transaction execution (prepare, execute, commit/rollback)

✅ CHUNK 5: Health Monitoring System (health_monitor.py)
   - Advanced server health checks with comprehensive metrics
   - Predictive failure analysis using trend detection
   - Real-time alerting system with severity levels and cooldowns
   - Health trend analysis (improving, stable, degrading)
   - Automatic failure detection and recovery monitoring
   - Performance metrics tracking and availability calculation
   - Alert callback system for integration with external systems
