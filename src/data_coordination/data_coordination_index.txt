Data Coordination Directory Index
==================================

Created: 2025-01-29
Purpose: System Integration Plan #3 - Data Flow Coordination

Files in this directory:

1. data_flow_coordinator.py
   - Created: 2025-01-29
   - Purpose: Comprehensive data flow coordination system
   - Features:
     * Real-time data routing and transformation
     * Flow control and backpressure management
     * Data validation and conflict resolution
     * Batch processing and streaming
     * Data lineage tracking
     * Performance monitoring and optimization
     * Fault tolerance and recovery
     * Component interface management
     * Queue management with backpressure detection
     * Automated cleanup and statistics collection
   - Key classes:
     * DataFlowCoordinator - Main coordination system
     * DataPacket - Individual data packet representation
     * DataFlow - Flow configuration between components
     * ComponentDataInterface - Component data interface configuration
   - Data flow types: price_data, arbitrage_opportunities, trade_executions, bridge_costs, wallet_balances, market_conditions, system_events, memory_updates, health_status, error_events
   - Priority levels: LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, CRITICAL, EMERGENCY
   - Flow directions: upstream, downstream, bidirectional, broadcast
   - Data states: pending, processing, completed, failed, expired
   - Status: COMPLETE - Ready for integration

2. __init__.py
   - Created: 2025-01-29
   - Purpose: Make data_coordination a proper Python package
   - Status: COMPLETE

Future files planned:
- flow_optimizer.py - Advanced flow optimization algorithms
- data_transformer.py - Specialized data transformation utilities
- conflict_resolver.py - Advanced conflict resolution strategies
- flow_analytics.py - Advanced flow pattern analysis
- stream_processor.py - Real-time stream processing utilities
